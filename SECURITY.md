# ICL Security Model

ICL is designed to minimize the attack surface of AI-driven execution.

## Threats Considered
- Shell injection
- Prompt injection
- Silent file modification
- Privilege escalation
- Recursive execution

## Mitigations
- Deterministic grammar
- No implicit execution
- Explicit modes
- Host-side validation
- Human approval boundary

AI systems cannot execute commands directly.
