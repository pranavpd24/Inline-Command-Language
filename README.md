# Inline Command Language (ICL) — v1.0

Inline Command Language (ICL) is a lightweight, deterministic execution protocol that allows AI systems to **propose system actions** without executing them directly.

ICL is designed for:
- human-in-the-loop AI agents
- secure local execution
- low-token-cost environments
- deterministic parsing and auditing

The AI describes *what should happen*.
The host system decides *if and how it happens*.
