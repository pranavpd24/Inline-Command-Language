# Inline Command Language (ICL) — v1.0

Inline Command Language (ICL) is a lightweight, deterministic execution protocol that enables AI systems to describe executable actions using a minimal text format optimized for **low token usage** and **simple parsing**.

ICL is designed for:
- terminal-native AI automation
- autonomous or semi-autonomous agents
- low-latency, low-cost LLM execution
- deterministic, regex-level parsing
- local and sandboxed execution environments

ICL focuses on *execution planning*, not conversation.
It minimizes structural overhead while remaining unambiguous and machine-safe.
